Bei der Black Card kannst Du außerdem so oft pro Anbieter gehen, wie Du willst.","The Email Address is incorrect":"Die Email-Adresse ist nicht korrekt","The White Card is £99 ":"Die White Card Lite kostet 39€, die White Card 69€ und die Black Card 99€.","You can cancel up to 8 hours before your class starts without incurring a fee. However, some of our partners require a longer period. All of this information is displayed on their profile on our website. ":"Du kannst Kurse in den meisten Fällen bis spätestens 4 Stunden vor Kursbeginn absagen. Allerdings gibt es bei einigen Anbietern eine längere Frist, die auf dem Studioprofil des entsprechenden Studios dargestellt ist.","You can participate in hundreds of classes and try a plethora of health and fitness disciplines whilst experiencing a variety of studios and teachers. Somuchmore is ideal, if you crave more variety in your fitness regime, want to learn new exercise styles and ways to train with noticeably more variety, motivation and success.":"Du kannst an hunderten Kursen teilnehmen und eine Vielzahl an Disziplinen, Studios und Lehrern ausprobieren. So trainierst Du mit spürbar mehr Abwechslung, Motivation und Erfolg und lernst ganz neue Sachen kennen.","Unlike gym or studio memberships, with Somuchmore you can take part in hundreds of classes and courses at countless studios and workshops. You’ll be welcomed in all studios as if you were one of their own members. ":"Du kannst nicht nur ein Studio besuchen, sondern hunderte Kurse von unzähligen Studios. Überall wirst Du wie ein Mitglied begrüßt - und kannst nach Herzlenslust trainieren.","Some selected partners, classes and workshops can only be visited by pre-booking online. This is displayed on each partner profile with the appropriate contact to make the reservation for you. However, the majority of our classes can be taken by just turning up.":"Einige ausgewählte Anbieter und Kurse können nur mit Voranmeldung besucht werden. Dies ist jeweils im Kursprofil angezeigt – mit der entsprechenden Kontaktadresse um die Reservierung zu tätigen. Die meisten unserer Kurse können allerdings ohne Voranmeldung besucht werden.","Get your invitation":"Erhalte Deine Einladung","At Somuchmore there are no hidden costs whatsoever. You will only be charged an additional cost if you attend a class that isn’t included in your membership, i.e. if you visit a studio more than three times a month. In this case we will charge you £16, which is the average price of a drop-in class for studios in the UK.":"Es gibt bei Somuchmore keinerlei versteckte Kosten. Zusätzliche Kosten fallen nur dann an, wenn Du einen Kurs besuchst, der nicht in Deiner Mitgliedschaft enthalten ist, also z.B. mit einer White Card Light mehr als 4 x pro Monat gehst oder mit einer White Card mehr als 3 x pro Monat zum selben Studio. Dann berechnen wir Dir pro Kursbesuch 16€, was dem Mittelwert der Drop-In Kurspreise eines Studios in Deutschland entspricht.","The Somuchmore membership means you can visit all classes, at all times at no additional cost at most of our partner studios, centers and workshops. Please note that some do have exceptions to these terms with peak times where classes are usually at full capacity. If you really want to go to a peak time class or a more expensive course, this can be arranged with us for an additional cost.":"Für den Großteil unserer Anbieter beinhaltet die Mitgliedschaft: Alle Kurse zu allen Zeiten ohne Mehrkosten. Bei einigen wenigen Ausnahmen können nicht alle Kurse eines Anbieters besucht werden, da diese bereits zu voll sind. Für ausgewählte Uhrzeiten oder aufwendigere Kurse, wie zum Beispiel Einzel-Einführungsstunden, wird der Zugang gegen stark vergünstigte Aufpreise ermöglicht.","We are also happy to activate your membership at a later date if you need to. If you change your mind and decide to attend classes before this date, we will just charge you the previous month’s membership fee retrospectively. ":"Gerne können wir Dein Kontingent und Deine Zahlung auch erst zu einem späteren Zeitpunkt starten lassen. Im Falle, dass Du Dich doch entscheidest bereits Kurse zu besuchen, buchen wir Dir rückwirkend den Mitgliedschaftspreis ab.","Are there any hidden costs?":"Gibt es versteckte Kosten?","Guide to Somuchmore":"Guide to Somuchmore","Is my place guaranteed if I sign up in advance for a class, course or workshop?":"Habe ich meinen Platz sicher, wenn ich mich vorher für einen Kurs anmelde?","At all of our partner studios.

In dieser Zeit kannst Du bis zu drei Kurse besuchen. Falls Du vom Vertrag zurück trittst, bekommst Du Dein Geld vollständig zurück.","Yes, when visiting and attending any offering, class, course or workshop, you will be asked to show your Somuchmore photo ID card. During the initial trial period, you will need to print your class reservation confirmation email and present this with a photo ID, like a driving license or passport.

":"Mit der White Card Lite kannst Du bis zu 4 Kurse im Monat besuchen. Mit der Black Card und der White Card kannst Du unbegrenzt Kurse besuchen. Die White Card hat dabei die Einschränkung, dass du nur 3 mal pro Anbieter und Monat Kurse besuchen kannst. Bei der Black Card kannst du so oft zu demselben Anbieter gehen wie Du willst.","Do I have to register in advance for courses?":"Muss ich mich vor Kursen vorher anmelden?","After you have registered and your payment has been confirmed, we’ll send you a confirmation email. The email will include your membership number and a temporary card that you can print out. Once you have this card you can use it immediately.":"Nachdem Du Dich angemeldet hast und Deine Zahlung bestätigt wurde, schicken wir Dir eine Bestätigungs-E-Mail.

Vergiss nicht uns Deine Kartennummer, Deinen Namen und die Mitteilung, zu welchem Zeitpunkt Du kündigen willst, mitzuteilen. Die Kündigung ist jeweils zum Folgemonat möglich.","Somuchmore only works with high-quality providers. In addition to this, we know every provider personally, visit every studio in person and speak with the teachers in great depth. That’s why at Somuchmore you will find only teachers who have undergone certified training, as well as studios that represent particularly high-quality courses.":"Somuchmore arbeitet nur mit Qualitätsanbietern. Darüber hinaus kennen wir jeden Anbieter persönlich, schauen uns jedes Studio an, sprechen ausführlich mit den Lehrern. Du wirst daher auf Somuchmore nur Lehrer finden, die eine zertifizierte Ausbildung haben, sowie Studios, die für besonders hohe Unterrichts-Qualität stehen.","If you wish to cancel your membership, simply send us an e-mail to <a href=\"mailto:info@somuchmore.org\">customerservice@somuchmore.org</a>.

The reason we do this is because the studio won’t be able to offer your reserved spot to anyone else in such a short time and would otherwise lose money. If the studio doesn’t require you to pre-book then it’s all a bit more relaxed: you don’t have to pay anything. Any member who repeatedly doesn't turn up to class, i.e. more than three times in one month, will no longer be able to continue their membership with Somuchmore. Don't worry though, we will notify you every time you don't turn up and try and make sure this doesn't happen!":"Wen der Anbieter für seinen Kurs eine Voranmeldung erfordert und Du verbindlich einen Platz reserviert hast, müssen wir Dir 16€ berechnen, falls Du nicht erscheinst. Das tun wir nicht gerne - aber der Anbieter vergibt den von Dir reservierten Platz an niemanden anders und verliert sonst Geld. Wenn der Anbieter keinen Online Check-In erfordert, ist die Lage entspannter: Du musst nichts bezahlen. Achte nur bitte darauf, dass so etwas nicht öfters passiert. Wer wiederholt, d.h. mehr als drei mal in einem Monat oder mehr als zwei Mal in drei aufeinanderfolgenden Monaten reserviert und nicht auftaucht, ohne abzusagen, kann bei Somuchmore nicht mehr dabei sein.","If the studio requires pre-booking for their class and you receive a confirmation email from them, this means your space is officially reserved. If the course doesn’t require you to sign up in advance, we suggest you turn up in good time in order to secure a place. You can find out how long each studio reccomends, by visiting their profile on our website.":"Wenn der Anbieter für seine Kurse eine Voranmeldung erfordert und Du eine Bestätigung bekommst, ist Dein Platz reserviert. Wenn der Kurs keine Voranmeldung erfordert, musst Du rechtzeitig da sein - und bekommst in der Regel immer Deinen Platz.","How does my Somuchmore membership end?":"Wie endet meine Somuchmore Mitgliedschaft?","How do I cancel my membership?":"Wie kündige ich meine Mitgliedschaft?","How can I guarantee everything that Somuchmore offers is of the highest quality?":"Wie wird die Qualität auf Somuchmore garantiert?","We believe that everyone has the capability to reach their full potential in life.

Und wir wollen Dich inspirieren, Dein Potenzial ganzheitlich zu entfalten, indem Du Körper, Geist und Seele trainierst.","You can cancel your Somuchmore membership monthly at no cost.
