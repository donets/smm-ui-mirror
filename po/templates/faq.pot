msgid "If the studio requires pre-booking for their class and you receive a confirmation email from them, this means your space is officially reserved. If the course doesn’t require you to sign up in advance, we suggest you turn up in good time in order to secure a place. You can find out how long each studio reccomends, by visiting their profile on our website."
msgstr ""

#: app/views/faq.html:82
msgid "If you have pre-booked your place in a class we unfortunately have to charge you £16 even if you don’t turn up.  The reason we do this is because the studio won’t be able to offer your reserved spot to anyone else in such a short time and would otherwise lose money. If the studio doesn’t require you to pre-book then it’s all a bit more relaxed: you don’t have to pay anything. Any member who repeatedly doesn't turn up to class, i.e. more than three times in one month, will no longer be able to continue their membership with Somuchmore. Don't worry though, we will notify you every time you don't turn up and try and make sure this doesn't happen!"
